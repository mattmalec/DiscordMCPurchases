# DiscordMCPurchases
A simple and straightforward Spigot plugin for Minecraft 1.8.8 that allows Discord users to purchase products on the Discord store, and receive Minecraft rewards for their purchases.

This plugin includes
* MySQL integration (it only works with MySQL)
* Complete Minecraft and Discord account linking
* Cached results (for faster responses and less slowing down your MySQL database)
* Custom placeholders
* Pretty much everything customizable
* Discord role rewards
    * You can customize which roles to add and remove from a Discord user on your guild
* Minecraft rewards
    * You can customize the commands ran via console upon a successful purchase
* Manual purchase checking
* Automatic purchase checking (customizable time in the config)
* Customized rewards per product
* Ability to claim multiple rewards at once

If you are going to use this plugin, please ensure the SKUs for your "game" are marked as IAP or In App Purchases. This is essential for the plugin to function.

You must also invite the bot to your Discord guild for the verification in the first place.
